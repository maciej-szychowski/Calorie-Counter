# Calorie-Counter
--------------------------

## Description

In this application we can count the calories of our meal. 
The application sums up calories from a given meal and displays the total amount of calories.
We can edit every meal. In the future I intend to expand the application so that data is downloaded from an external api.
It will also be possible to calculate your caloric demand and compare it with the sum of calories from meals.
